Wildfire Simulator
CS 132: Computer Science II C++, Winter 2023 Final Group Project
Group 3: Dillon Donohue & Lucas Henderson

This simulation will demonstrate how a wildfile
spreads through an environment of fuel sources
including grass, young forest, and old forest.
Firefighting countermeasures have been deployed
in the simulated environment to slow the spread
of the fire, these countermeasures include fire
retardant and fire breaks.
