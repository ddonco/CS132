Final Project - Milestone 2, 03/04/23

The WildFireSim application simulates a wildfire where a fire has broken out among
natural fuel sources including grass, young forest, and old forest. The model simulates
the spread of the fire and a GUI displays the spread of the fire. Firefighting countermeasures
such as fire breakes and fire retardant are also included in the model to simulate
their effect on the spread of a wildfire.
